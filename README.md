# Unity Touhou - Bullet Hell Game <img src="/readmeImg.png" width="5%" heright="5%">

Welcome to Unity-Touhou, a personnal project currently in the making.
Useful scripts are located in Assets/Scripts/..

## Getting Started

This repository has for objective of practicing Architectural Design Pattern, Memory Management / Optimization
and prioritize Composition over Inheritance.

#### Game Mechanics and Features

  * Input System
  * Pattern Generation ðŸ‘» (*early stage*)
  * Collision System (*thinking about using RTree to make access bullets depending on the area they are in and make things more efficient*)
  * Player Mechanics
  * Movement Mechanics (*need to  implement more variation of pattern to follow for units*)
  * UI Management
  * Bullet Management
  * Unit Management
  * Wave System (*units can spawn from both side following either a linear progression OR a cubic bezier curve*)
  * Audio Management

#### Design Pattern and Memory Optimization

  * Factory Pattern
  * Object Pooling
  * Batching
  * Strategy Pattern
  * Observer Pattern (*will have to implement an event system to trigger animation when limit scores are reach*)

#### Tools
  * XML Serialization (*Currently manage position in a file called : GameInfo and the instanciation of units inside the file : LevelInfo -> Both are accessible at the solution level*)
  * SQLite Database Handler (*Manage the access to the database, allow for dynamic loading of data - will also handle the dynamic loading for the waypoint system and the wave system in the futur - allowing to get rid of the XML Serialization*)
